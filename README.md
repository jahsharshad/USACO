# USACO-Bronze
This repository includes the code used to prepare for and compete in the USA Computing Olympiad Exam. I cleared the Bronze Division with a perfect score of 1000/1000 in January 2021 and am currently part of the Silver Division.

The United States of America Computing Olympiad is a computer programming competition primarily for secondary school students in the United States. The USACO offers four competitions during the academic year in four increasingly difficult divisions: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.
